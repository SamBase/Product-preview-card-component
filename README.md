## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Git

### What I learned

Using diffrent images based on display using HTML
```HTML
<picture class="product-image">   
  <source
    srcset="./images/image-product-desktop.jpg"
    media="(min-width: 375px)"
  />
  <source
    srcset="./images/image-product-mobile.jpg"
    media="(min-width: 1px)"
  />
  <img src="./images/image-product-desktop.jpg" alt="perfume" srcset="" class="view">
</picture>
```

To remove the unexpected gap at the bottom of the image using these rules
```css
.view{
  ...
  display: block;
  margin: auto;
  ...
}
```

### Continued development

Dealing with images when the screen size or parent container size changes.

### Useful resources

- [Responsive Images](https://css-tricks.com/a-guide-to-the-responsive-images-syntax-in-html/) - This helped in changing images when screen size changes, using only HTML tags.
